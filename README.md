First project with node.js

This is my first project on GitHub and I want to acheive this:
Trying to change this locally and push to github. One more change. Getting Diff.

1. Understand and learn Github
2. Node.js
3. Docker container and Kubernetes
4. Deploy of one of cloud servers, like AWS, GCP or azure.
